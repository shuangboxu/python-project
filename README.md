# python-project

This repository is organized for a typical data science workflow. The directory structure includes dedicated folders for raw, interim, and processed datasets, exploratory notebooks, reusable scripts, generated reports, and application code.

```
python-project/
  data/
    raw/
    interim/
    processed/
  notebooks/
  scripts/
  reports/
    figures/
  app/
```

Placeholder `.gitkeep` files are added to each empty directory so Git tracks the structure.
