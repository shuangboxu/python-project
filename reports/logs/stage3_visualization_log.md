# Stage 3 Â· Visualization & Web Experience Log

- Generated `reports/logs/recommendation_data.json` using `scripts/generate_recommendation_dataset.py`.
  - The dataset blends the final recommendation scores with raw TMDb metadata.
  - Adds age-restriction signals and language catalogues (ISO language codes mapped to readable labels) for front-end filtering.
- Built a single-page site in `app/` titled **Cinematic Compass** with:
  - Hero section and responsive card grid for the top-ranked movies.
  - Age-aware filtering that hides mature-genre titles for viewers younger than 18.
  - Language selector powered by the aggregated spoken-language metadata.
  - Keyword search spanning titles, genres, and curated keywords.
  - Direct links to each movie's homepage (or TMDb fallback when missing).
- Styling crafted in `app/styles.css` for a cinematic look and polished interactions.
- Client-side logic (`app/app.js`) loads the JSON data, renders cards, and applies dynamic filters.
